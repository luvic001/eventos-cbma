        </div>
        <div class="editor-content">
          <p>The São Paulo Arbitration Week (SPAW) is a collaborative event conceived as an organized calendar for law firms, universities, associations and institutions to promote events in a productive environment in benefit of the development of ADRs.</p>
          <p>The event is an opportunity for the ever-growing arbitration community in São Paulo to discuss pressing issues and to exchange experiences with foreign practitioners. </p>
          <p>São Paulo has experienced an unprecedented growth in ADRs. Friendly Courts, state-of-the-art infrastructure and a demanding market forged São Paulo as a natural hub for International Arbitration. </p>
          <p>Therefore, and considering the wide range of events happening in October connected to the subject, SPAWs role is to facilitate and gather all the information concerning these events. </p>
          <p>An opportunity such as the São Paulo Arbitration Week could not be missed.</p>
